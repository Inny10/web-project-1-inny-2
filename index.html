        In a country shaped by Ferrari’s roar and Lamborghini’s excess,
        perfection seemed already claimed. The roads of Italy echoed with
        legacy, power, and pride; names etched into history, untouchable and
        absolute. Yet in the shadows of this dominance, another vision took
        form. Not born from racing bloodlines or corporate ambition, but from
        patience, faith, and an unforgiving pursuit of beauty. Steel was treated
        like sculpture. Speed like emotion. Craftsmanship like religion. This
        was not rebellion. It was inevitability.
      </p>
      <p>Ferrari screamed. Lamborghini flaunted. Italy listened.</p>
